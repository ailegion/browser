# Roadmap

Each phase ends with something that runs. The exit criteria are the schedule;
there are no time estimates. Do not start a phase until the previous one's
criteria pass. Within a phase, the order of the work list is the recommended
build order.

## Phase 0: Skeleton, policy, one resolved crate set

**Status: done 2026-09-26.** Workspace builds on Windows (x86_64-pc-windows-gnu),
`cargo deny check bans` passes, `cargo test` passes, `browser --smoke` opens
a window on Vulkan, renders a frame and exits 0. Unsafe baseline is in
`06-unsafe-baseline.md`. Git is handled by the owner, never by the
assistant.

Goal: a workspace where the pure-Rust and no-unsafe rules are enforced by CI
before any feature code exists.

Work:

1. Workspace with the crate layout from `02-architecture.md`. Every crate has
   `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` except `platform`.
2. `Cargo.toml` profiles: `panic = "unwind"` in both dev and release.
3. `deny.toml` with the ban list from `03-crates.md`. CI runs
   `cargo deny check bans`, `cargo geiger` on the parser crates, and a grep of
   `cargo tree -e build` for `cc`, `cmake`, `pkg-config`.
4. Add the full Phase 1 crate set with pinned versions; resolve once; record
   the versions in `03-crates.md`. Check `cssparser` resolves to exactly one
   version.
5. Audit unsafe in the byte-parsing dependencies (`image` decoders,
   `html5ever`, `cssparser`, `boa_engine`, `rustls-rustcrypto`, `flate2`,
   `brotli`, `hyper`). Record counts. Pick `image` decoder features by
   result.
6. `ipc-types`: `ShellToTab`, `TabToShell`, `TabToNet`, `NetToTab` enums with
   `serde` derives. Variants may be stubs.
7. `shell`: winit window, wgpu device, vello renderer, clear to a color,
   handles resize and scale-factor change.

Exit criteria:

- Builds on Windows. `cargo deny check` and the unsafe audit pass in CI.
- Window opens, clears, resizes, and survives a monitor DPI change.
- Unsafe counts for parser crates are recorded as the baseline.

## Phase 1: Static page renderer

**Status: done 2026-09-26, with the caveats below.** `browser <url>` opens a
window and renders the page; `--screenshot FILE` saves it. Verified on
example.com, the Wikipedia article on Rust, and docs.rs (serde): all three
render recognizably with correct fonts, images and list markers. 48 unit
tests plus a snapshot suite and a malformed-input suite pass.

Caveats carried forward (all logged in `05-risks-and-open-items.md`):

- Floats are placed (taffy 0.14 has float support) but line boxes do not
  shorten around them, so a floated Wikipedia infobox overlaps the text
  beside it. This is the most visible defect and moves up to Phase 2 (O12).
  Fixed 2026-09-26 in Phase 2 item 0.
- CSS custom properties are not implemented, so sites that color through
  `var()` (docs.rs's dark nav bar) fall back to transparent. Phase 2 as
  planned. Fixed 2026-09-26 in Phase 2 item 0. (docs.rs's current sheet
  gives the nav bar a light background through `var(--color-background)`;
  the sidebar gray and the borders are the visible change.)
- Progressive rendering while the main document streams is not done; the
  page appears when the HTML finishes. External stylesheets and images do
  trigger re-renders as they arrive.
- Snapshot PNGs depend on installed fonts, so they are only comparable on
  the machine that produced them (O11).
- Legacy encodings: bytes are decoded as UTF-8 with replacement. Charset
  detection through `encoding_rs` is still to do.
- The cascade on the Wikipedia article (19k elements, 230 KB of CSS) takes
  213 ms in a release build and about 2 s in a debug build after rule
  bucketing (O13). Selector-based invalidation stays a Phase 2 item.

Goal: fetch a URL, paint it, scroll it. No script, no chrome, no clicking.

Work:

1. `net`: hyper + rustls-rustcrypto client. GET, redirects, gzip and br,
   streaming body chunks to a channel. Timeouts. `http` and `https` only.
2. `dom`: slotmap arena, `TreeSink` for html5ever, traversal, a text dump
   for tests.
3. `style`: property table (build-script generated from a Rust table file),
   parser over `cssparser`, cascade with `selectors`, inheritance and
   computed values. Initial property subset: `display` (block, inline,
   inline-block, none, flex), box model (margin, padding, border, width,
   height, min/max), `color`, `background-color`, `background-image`
   (url only), `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `font-style`,
   `line-height`, `text-align`, `text-decoration`, `white-space`,
   `position` (static, relative, absolute), `top/right/bottom/left`,
   `overflow`, `visibility`, `list-style-type`. A UA stylesheet for HTML
   defaults.
4. `layout`: box tree with anonymous boxes, taffy tree bridge, parley for
   inline content with a taffy measure function, absolute positioning.
5. `paint`: fragments to `vello::Scene`: backgrounds, borders, text runs,
   images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP), clipping for `overflow: hidden`.
6. Fonts: `fontique` system fonts with a fallback chain so non-Latin text and
   emoji render.
7. `tab`: the event loop with parser, restyle, relayout, paint; whole-tree
   restyle on any change is fine here.
8. Scrolling: wheel input from the shell changes a root scroll offset; only
   the scene is rebuilt.
9. Snapshot tests: local HTML fixtures rendered to PNG through vello, compared
   pixel-for-pixel in CI.

Exit criteria:

- `https://example.com`, a Wikipedia article, and a docs.rs page render
  recognizably from the network with correct fonts and images and scroll
  smoothly.
- Snapshot suite passes deterministically on CI.
- A deliberately malformed HTML, CSS, PNG, and JPEG fixture each render
  something or show a crashed-tab result; none takes the process down.

## Phase 2: Interaction, navigation, tabs, chrome

Goal: usable as a browser for pages that do not need JavaScript.

Work:

0. Line boxes shortened around floats (O12), CSS custom properties, and
   charset detection with `encoding_rs`: the three Phase 1 caveats that
   affect the most pages. Floats: done 2026-09-26 (`crates/layout`, five
   new unit tests, snapshot fixture `03-floats.html`, verified on the
   Wikipedia Rust article). Custom properties: done 2026-09-26
   (`crates/style/src/custom.rs`; `--name` declarations kept as text and
   inherited as a shared map, `var()` values substituted and parsed per
   element with fallbacks, chains, cycles and the `unset` rule for invalid
   references; seven new tests; verified on docs.rs). Known gap: `url()`
   inside a custom property value is not resolved against the sheet's
   URL. Charset detection: next.
1. Hit testing over layout fragments. `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus` through
   the style engine with per-subtree dirty bits.
2. Link navigation, redirects, `<meta http-equiv=refresh>`, fragment scroll.
3. Navigation state machine and history per tab: back, forward, reload,
   stop. History entry commits on first response bytes.
4. Per-origin cookie jar and in-memory HTTP cache in `net`.
5. Multiple tabs: one thread each, `catch_unwind` at the boundary, crashed
   tab page, thread and memory released on close (leak test).
6. `chrome`: widgets (button, text input with cursor/selection/clipboard/IME,
   tab strip, menu, tooltip, scrollbar, progress), laid out with taffy,
   drawn with vello. Address bar, back, forward, reload, new tab, close tab,
   loading indicator, HTTPS indicator, settings menu.
7. Text selection and copy on pages. Find in page. Keyboard focus and tab
   order. Form controls rendered (no submission yet).
8. Media queries and custom properties in `style`.
9. CI matrix: Windows, Linux, macOS builds.

Exit criteria:

- Browse from a Wikipedia article through five links and back in two tabs
  using the address bar and buttons, on all three platforms.
- Closing a tab frees its thread and memory.
- Cookies persist across navigations within the session.
- A tab that panics shows a crashed page while the other tab keeps working.

## Phase 3: JavaScript

Goal: sites that need script start working.

Work:

1. Boa `Context` per document on the tab thread. `JobQueue` implementation
   integrated with the tab loop: macrotasks, microtask checkpoint after each,
   timers, `requestAnimationFrame` before paint.
2. Script loading: inline, external, `async`, `defer`, `type=module` with a
   loader that fetches through `net`. Parser blocking for sync scripts.
3. Bindings in this order, each unlocking more of the web:
   1. `window`, `document`, `console`, timers, `location`, `navigator`.
   2. `Node`, `Element`, `Text`, `Document`: traversal, mutation,
      `querySelector*`, attributes, `classList`, `innerHTML` (fragment
      parser), `textContent`, `dataset`.
   3. `EventTarget`, `Event`, `MouseEvent`, `KeyboardEvent`, `InputEvent`,
      capture and bubble, `preventDefault`, `addEventListener` options.
   4. `element.style` as `CSSStyleDeclaration`, `getComputedStyle`,
      `getBoundingClientRect`, scroll properties.
   5. `fetch`, `Response`, `Request`, `Headers`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `URL`,
      `URLSearchParams`, `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`, `Blob`, `FormData`.
   6. `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `history.pushState`/`popstate`.
   7. Forms: values, `submit`, validation basics.
   8. `MutationObserver`, `IntersectionObserver`, `ResizeObserver`.
4. Same-origin policy, CORS with preflight, CSP `script-src` and
   `connect-src`, mixed-content blocking.
5. Headless mode that loads a URL and prints results, used to run a chosen
   Web Platform Tests subset in CI. The subset list lives in
   `tests/wpt-subset.txt` and may only grow.

Exit criteria:

- A locally served React or Vue todo app works end to end.
- The WPT subset passes in CI and is enforced against regression.
- A page with an infinite loop does not freeze the shell; a "stop script"
  action ends it.

## Phase 4: Persistence, passwords, downloads, ad blocking

Goal: the privacy and blocking features that are the reason this browser
exists.

Work:

1. `store`: encrypted file per profile, argon2 + chacha20poly1305, optional
   passphrase with UI to set, change, and remove it. Random sidecar key when
   unset, with the UI stating plainly that this is not protection.
2. On tab close: cookies, localStorage, and saved passwords for that tab's
   origins go to the store. Cache never does. On start: store decrypts into
   memory once.
3. History and bookmarks: browser-level, persisted through the store,
   with UI (history page, bookmark bar or menu).
4. Password manager: detect login forms, offer to save, autofill on the same
   origin only, never on a different origin.
5. Downloads: `DownloadRequested` from tab, native save dialog via `rfd`,
   shell writes the file, progress UI, never opens or executes.
6. Ad blocking: `adblock::Engine` in `net`, list management UI, default
   lists chosen by the owner, per-site toggle, cosmetic filtering injected
   as a user stylesheet, scriptlets through Boa, blocked-count badge.
7. Settings page: JavaScript per-site toggle, passphrase, lists, default
   search engine (user-settable, no default that phones home).

Exit criteria:

- Log into a site, close the tab, reopen, still logged in. Restart the
  browser, still logged in. Nothing from the cache is on disk (checked by a
  test that inspects the profile folder).
- With a passphrase set, the profile file is unreadable without it.
- Download a file to a chosen folder; the browser never opens it.
- A known ad-heavy page shows no ads with default lists; the badge counts
  blocked requests.

## Phase 5: Breadth

Goal: fewer broken sites. This phase does not end; items are prioritized by
what breaks the most pages.

- Layout: tables, floats, `position: sticky`, multi-column, writing modes,
  `aspect-ratio`, `object-fit`.
- Style: transitions and animations wired to rAF, `@font-face` web fonts,
  `filter`, `backdrop-filter`, `mask`, `clip-path`, gradients, shadows,
  selector-based invalidation for performance.
- Images: SVG via `usvg` to vello, `<picture>` and `srcset`, lazy loading.
- Web APIs: `WebSocket`, Canvas 2D on vello, `postMessage`, `iframe`
  (each frame is its own document on the same tab thread), `Web Workers`
  (a separate Boa context on its own thread, message passing only),
  `Notification` (in-app only), clipboard API with permission.
- Audio via `symphonia` (pure Rust). Video decoding: no production pure-Rust
  decoder exists; out of scope until one does.
- Accessibility via `accesskit`.
- Printing to PDF, session restore, reader mode, DevTools (DOM inspector and
  console over the existing channels), extensions (only if a pure-Rust
  design is found that keeps D01).
- Optional per-platform OS sandboxing as an additional layer (D01 says it
  is never a dependency).

## Dependency order

```
Phase 0 ─► net ──────────────────────────┐
        ─► dom ─► style ─► layout ─► paint ─┴─► tab loop ─► Phase 1 exit
                              ▲
                fonts, images ┘
Phase 2: hit test ─► navigation ─► tabs ─► chrome ─► CI matrix
Phase 3: job queue ─► bindings 1-2 ─► events ─► fetch ─► forms ─► WPT
Phase 4: store ─► persistence on close ─► passwords ─► downloads ─► adblock
```

Build `ipc-types` in Phase 0 even though it looks premature. Every layer
talks only through it, which keeps the shell, tab, and network code from
growing into one another.
